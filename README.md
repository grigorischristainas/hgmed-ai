# pubmed-ai

Streamline the process of identifying and choosing optimal RCTs by leveraging cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The PubMED AI web application empowers users to search through PubMED RCT paper abstracts related to a specific intervention or disease. Furthermore, the abstracts will be supplemented with supplementary information, including details about the intervention, disease and effectiveness, extracted through Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The repository consists of a front-end React application (pubmed-ai) and a back-end Flask API (pubmed-ai-api). You can navigate into each project's directory and follow the instructions in each corresponding README.md files to get started.

Happy research!
