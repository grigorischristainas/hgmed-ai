        title: 'Comparison of the effects of one-level and bi-level pre-incisional erector spinae plane block on postoperative acute pain in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial',
        abstract:
            'This prospective, randomized, double-blind trial aimed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of One-Level pre-incisional erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and Bi-Level pre-incisional ESPB in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).This pilot trial was conducted between April 2022 and February 2023 with sixty patients. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. In One-Level ESPB Group (n = 30) block was performed at the thoracal(T)5 level with the 30 ml 0.25% bupivacaine. In the Bi-Level ESPB Group (n = 30) block was performed at T4 and T6 levels by using 15 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine for each level. In the postoperative period, 50 mg dexketoprofen every 12 h and 1 g paracetamol every 8 h were given intravenously (IV). Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) prepared with morphine was applied to the patients. 0.5 mg/kg of tramadol was administered via IV for rescue analgesia. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded in the postoperative 1VAS scores at resting were statistically significantly higher at the 1Adequate analgesia was achieved in the early postoperative period in the group treated with Bi-Level ESPB with similar morphine consumption and side effects. This may be an advantage, especially in the early postoperative period when the pain is quite intense.',

        title: 'The comparison of intraincisional bupivacaine infiltration and intravenous paracetamol administration for pain alleviation after cesarean section: a double-blinded randomized placebo controlled clinical trial.',
        abstract:
            'This study aimed to compare the analgesic effect of subcutaneous (SC) bupivacaine and intravenous (IV) paracetamol on postoperative pain and opioid requisites in patients undergoing cesarean delivery.One hundred and five women were allocated into 3 groups in this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Group 1 received SC bupivacaine, Group 2 received IV paracetamol following surgery and every 6 hours for 24 hours in the postoperative period, Group 3 received SC 0.9% saline and IV 0.9% saline at similar periods. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores at rest and coughing, at 15 and 60 minutes, and 2, 6 and 12 hours, and total opioid necessity were measured.VAS scores at rest were higher in placebo group than in bupivacaine and paracetamol groups at 15 minutes (p=0.047) and 2 hours (p=0.004). VAS scores at coughing were higher in placebo group than in bupivacaine and paracetamol groups at 2 hour (p=0.001) and 6 hours (p=0.018). Placebo group needed higher (p<0.001) doses of morphine than paracetamol or bupivacaine groups.Intravenous paracetamol decreases pain scores similar to SC bupivacaine in the postoperative period compared to placebo. Patients taking bupivacaine or paracetamol need fewer opioids than placebo.',
